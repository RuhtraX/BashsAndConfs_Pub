## Use Once
Scripts created with the purpose of doing something, ended being used only once and can be adapted for doing similar things, for example:

### sync.sh
Useful for syncing audio and video of a video file using ffmpeg

### yamiconv
Used for converting files within a subfolder that will be passed as an argument.
